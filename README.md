2. You've good documentation or guidelines to use your project.
3. You have at least 90% test coverage and it is mentioned on README.md
4. Project license don't stop users to try it.

1. Necessary detail of your project in summary (rest detail can be read from the README.md of your project) 
2. Comparision with existing libraries to know people why should they switch.
3. Aim/purpose of your project
